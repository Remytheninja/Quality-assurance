        <h2>What is this quality assurance? Listen carefully</h2>
        <p>
            Quality Assurance (QA) is a systematic process used to ensure that a product or service meets specified requirements and standards. In the context of software development, QA involves the activities and practices that monitor the production process to improve and maintain the quality of software products.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h3> SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO IMAGES?</h3>
        <p>
            Quality assurance helps a company create products and services that meet the needs, expectations and requirements of customers. It yields high-quality product offerings that build trust and loyalty with customers. The standards and procedures defined by a quality assurance program help prevent product defects before they arise.
        </p>
        <h3>Before going to the topic, you should know what is quality.</h3>
        <p> Take this for example</p> 
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <p>Suppose you go to a hotel, in a normal hotel and you want to have tea or coffee, the price will be very affordable to you, right? <br></p>
            <img src="img/hotel.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="emphasis">It will be very cheap right?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph-text">But at the same time if you are going to a five star hotel for the same tea, you have to pay more than that.</p>
        <img src="img/five star.jpg" alt="five star" class="image-size">
        <h3>What is the difference?</h3>
      
        <div class="image-contain">
            <img src="img/five star.jpg" alt="five star" class="image-size">
            <img src="img/hotel.jpg" alt=""class="image-size">
        </div>
        <h2>The difference is related to quality only</h2> 
        <p>The quality of the product used in that tea. 
            Regarding the milk and the sugar and the tea powder and regarding the service, regarding the atmosphere, everything will be different in five star hotel.
        </p>
        <h2>So the price will also will be different.</h2>
        <p>What is the difference?</p>
        <h1 class="quality"> Quality</h1>
        <p>They are giving quality. Simple!! Quality is the meeting need of the customer both internally and externally.</p>
        <h2>You can define quality assurance as a systematic effort to maintain satisfactory performance.</h2>
        <p>For example, a systematic effort is maintained by starlink to give best internet kuliko Safaricom. You see this is? QUALITY</p>
        <h1 class="steps">Quality Assurance Steps</h1>
        <p>Just look at this image and you will understand</p>
        <img src="img/steps.jpg" alt="">
        <p>If you didn't get that use this one below you will understand properly</p>

        <p>Imagine yourself as a <span class="check">Quality assurance officer</span> you will better understand this concept. Your work is to check kama vitu ziko sawa, <span class="check">you tick boxes, you send out your analysis.</span> It's all about checking the quality.</p>
        <h3>So these are the steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Planning: Defining standards, tools, and methodologies that will guide the QA process.</li>
            <li>Documentation: Writing test plans, test cases, and setting up procedures.</li>
            <li>Designing Tests: Based on specifications, testers create cases that will be executed to check functionality and performance.</li>
            <li>Execution: Testers run the planned tests and document results.</li>
            <li>Analysis: Results are analyzed to identify trends, root causes of defects, or areas for improvement.</li>
            <li>Reporting: Issues and improvements are communicated to the relevant stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Verification and Validation: Ensuring that the final product meets the original requirements (validation) and adheres to the predefined processes (verification).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>After the steps we need to see how to manage project quality.(kumanage project ikuwe ya kishua)</h3>
        <p>Let's first see the importance</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Customer Satisfaction: Projects must meet customer requirements to ensure satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Risk Mitigation: Identifying risks early helps in reducing the chances of defects and rework.</li>
            <li>Cost Savings: Fewer defects lead to cost reduction by minimizing rework and enhancing project efficiency.</li>
            <li>Reputation: Delivering high-quality outcomes boosts the organization’s credibility and trust in the market.</li>
        </ol>

                <ul>
                    <b>Purpose</b>: Identifies the root causes of quality problems by analyzing potential factors contributing to defects or issues. <br>
                    <b>How It Works</b>: Lists major categories (e.g., people, machines, methods, materials) and maps out potential causes of a quality issue under each category.
                </ul>
            </li> <br>
            <li>Pareto Analysis
                <ul>
                    <b>Purpose</b>: Helps prioritize quality problems based on their impact, following the 80/20 rule (80% of problems come from 20% of causes). <br>
                    <b>How It Works</b>: Uses a bar chart to focus efforts on the most significant issues to maximize improvement.
                </ul><br>

            <li>Control Charts
                <ul>
                    <b>Purpose</b>: Monitors process performance over time and identifies any variations outside control limits. <br>
                    <b>How It Works</b>: Plots data points over time, with upper and lower control limits indicating acceptable variations. Points outside these limits signal potential issues.
                </ul><br>
            </li>
            <li> Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
                <ul>
                    <b>Purpose</b>: Identifies potential failure modes in a process and their effects to prioritize preventive measures. <br>
                    <b>How It Works</b>: Evaluates risks by assessing the severity, occurrence, and detectability of possible failures, calculating a risk priority number (RPN).
